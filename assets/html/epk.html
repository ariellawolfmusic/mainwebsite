      <h2 class='text-center'>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        A band formed in the year 100 AD by the name of <i>electrica testudines</i> consisting of 2 members, a close relative of Christ himself, and the devil. After a surprising dissapearance, the 2 have reappeared in the year 2021, as Pedro Sanchez, son of Dr. Michael Sanchez, and The Beast From The Middle East, son of Thor. Their current sound is similar to that of the stomping gladiotors, the wretched depths of rock and roll, which some call hell. Armed with electric guitar and drums, Electric Turtles are unstoppable.

        Would you like to hear a little story, children?
        This one is passed down from my grandfather and his grandfather and many more grandfathers before. 
        It is the tale of the 8 armed beast!
        From the Middle East. 
        The legend goes that he was born from a boar and an antelope in the heart of the forest.
        As a child he scavenged for his own sustience. They said that on the eve of the purple moon, the beast met his nemesis.
        On this night commenced the largest battle ever known to mankind!
        The beast pulled the sound of thunder from the heavens
        And his nemesis pulled the screeches of hell up onto this earth.
        When there forces clashed an energy was formed that permeated the earths surface.
        Something that would shake the foundations of this land for many years to come.
        Something called alternative rock.
        oooo.
        But the two dissapeard mysteriously and vanished without a trace leaving us with only their stories to tell.
        And that is why we wait for the purple moon to come again. But it hasn’t come for a thousand years. We wait tirelessly 
        Day in and day out for that little glimpse of hope in the skies. But that is merely a story, my children…
