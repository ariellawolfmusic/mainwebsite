          <h2>THE TOUR</h2>
          <h5>April 12th-14th 2018</h5>
          Alright, because I failed to have time to reflect on the shows, as there wasn't so much alone time, I'll start where I left off: <br>
          <h5>April 12th</h5>
          Mittweida. 
          I think I’d describe the evening as ‘liebevoll’. I think that means it’s was lovely, and it totally was. 
          To recap the day: Chris picked me up and we went to our practice room to pick up our backline, and to spray paint the fucking bass drum. I had cut out a stencil “ET!” on a regular sheet of paper, Chris got black and white spray paint, and we gave it a go. 
          This was the end result: 

          It didn’t turn out how we wanted it, but on stage it actually looks really cool :) 
          It’s always interesting to me, playing music how so much of the day is just whizzing by, then you perform, and it’s a good hour of adrenaline and some sort of spiritual experience with the gods of music, then you meet people, sell merch, and it’s over. <br>
          I'm not sure what music means to people, I'm not sure what it means to me, either. All I know is that human connection is one major part of a good and meaningful life, and that music is a direct stream to connect with other people. <br>
          There's not really much going on in Mittweida, besides the students. The show was dope as usual for me and Chris, I think it's pretty hard for us to have any serious problems that would majorly fuck up a show, I mean, it is rock and roll after all. But, the crowd wasn't exactly ready to party like we were -- not everyone at least, but after the show, the amount of love and appreciated we recieved was completely unexpected. People were buying shirts and CD's, and one dude even said if we gave him stickers he will spread our turtle juice all over Germany. hehe. I also realized how completely dope the lazer turtle t-shirts are (that's Manuel from the club): <br>

            </div>
          </div>
          IT WAS TOO SEXY!<br>
          Did I mention that we stayed on a farm that night? A dude named Jens has an Airbnb near Mittweida (recommended should you want to run away for a bit into the middle of nowhere in Saxony), and I was super confused when he spoke perfect English. Turns out he lived in Ireland for fifteen years. There were sheep, goats, ducks, a dog named Paula, and probably more shit I can't remember. I took a bath there. It was incredible. I haven't taken a bath in so damn long. Me and Lena only have a shower, and holy shit, baths are my jam. It was the most incredible 15 minutes I've had in a while. <br>
          And in the morning, mothafuka Jens made us a kickass breakfast.

          <br>
          Then we went to some place in the forest that looked like it would have been super cool in the summer, but because it's not so warm was quite deserted. We were hoping to get on a boat around this lake, but it didn't happen. Instead we ate some food. Oh that reminds me, it was awesome having Paul on tour with us. Having an extra hand to do things like, carrying shit, social media, and taking out my pedal board while I'm in the bathroom, was extremely helpful. That's him with Paula above. Then, we went to Chemnitz. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <h5>April 13th</h5>
          What a grey city that is. I mean, I've been to Chemnitz before, and will never forget how a man Heiled Hitler there, in 2017. Brought back some uncomfortable memories of my ancectors in the past... 
          But at least we got a picture with our homie Marx:

            </div>
          </div>
          I think we were a little skeptical of how the night would turn out in a place called 'Zukunft'. The club is pretty well known, and our name was on the front of their building which was cool. And GURR had played there two years earlier, so we felt like we were doing something quite epic. (p.s. we love gurr). It's a super punk rock venue, with great vegan food, and really nice staff. The room we'd play in was super tiny, and we were gonna fuck the shit out the air their with big ass sounds from outerspace (at least that's what I set out to do). Sound check took a bit longer than expected, and we tried to nap in the band flat an hour before the show but it totally didn't work and instead we just made jokes. The audience for the night was gonna be people who had gone to the theater, and we were the afterparty. I didn't really get the concept, but, the room actually filled up quite nicely! I'm always a bit surprised when things turn out better than I expect them to. <br>
          And people seemed down to party, which was dope. But no one bought any merch, which was a bit sad. I guess you can never know what's gonna happen - I mean, no one danced in Mittweida but we sold a shit load of merch. And in Chemnitz they partied but bought nothing. CONFUSING. We just wanna spread the turtle love. <br>
          yeah we wanna play with Gurr. Super badly. hehe. Chemnitz was cool<br> 
          <h5>April 14th</h5>
          Last day of tour, we woke up and moved our asses to Weimar. FUCK, what a beautiful city. Tiny town vibes, green, good bratwurst, and beautiful people. We played in the sickest venue, a theater, and theater people know how to get shit done. Probably the best sound we had on tour. Gotta thank Princes of Provinces for letting us open for their album release concert. I was feeling pretty tired before the show, but as always we gathered up the energy to rock out. See how pretty it is?

            </div>
          </div>
          Shows go by so fuckin fast. The days are long, the shows are short, the nervouseness before a show is long, then the confused state of mind after the show is long. I think that's why I like talking to people after shows. I don't know what to do with myself or my thoughts once I'm off the stage. And it takes me a while after a show to come down, maybe from excitment. But, now we're back, and I have time to reflect, and I don't know if reflecting is pointless, or worth it. Probably worth it. I love touring, I love sharing music with people. I love playing music, I love writing music. Man. We stopped at McDonalds on the way home. It was okay.
          <br>
          ELECTRIC TURTLES makes ACTION ROCK music. Paul thought of that, and it makes perfect sense. Our music is a big BANG in your face. <br>
          Now it's time to prepare for the album, and Chris is on tour the next three weeks, so I gotta hit the preproduction vocals and guitars, so we are sure we have enough time to do EVERYTHING we want. 
          <br> 
          Until next time, <br>
          Arik

          <h2>TURTLE JUICE FUNKY EXPLOSION</h2>
          Howdy folks! It's Arik here. I'm hard coding this html right now, because it makes me feel super 90's and like I'm doing something vintage and important. This blog is for everyone who really wants to know what the fuck we are about. :) And well, beacuse I am narrating this, welcome to the world of ELECTRIC TURTLES through the eyes of Arik. I'll try and speak for Chris, but he only speaks Spanish, so it might be a little difficult. <br>
          Tomorrow, we begin our first ever Germany tour. Though it's just three shows, it's still the first time we are going on tour in Germany! Which is super exciting for me. We've already toured Israel, which is much farther away than our little homeland of Germany, but we are now gonna be leaving with our full backline plus Paul, making this feel much more like a tour should feel (even if we're not covering SO many kilometers). <br>
          The romantic vision of a band going out on the road is engraved heavily in my head, and I can't wait to rock out for three nights in a row. <br>
          oooo today I finished my pedalboard setup for now -- I'm splitting my guitar signal three times, into my Vox, Fender rumble, and a little Marshall practice amp that Lena got me a while ago for my birthday. I'm putting a delay in front of the little Marshall, and holy shit, all three amps on full blast, is like an army of Rock. It's surprising what little amps can actually do. Because there's just two of us, I gotta find a way to make us sound like we are BIG. And I think three amps does just that, especially as I am switching between the Vox, and all three at once. <br>
          Yeah, that's about it. I'll keep ya'll updated the next days! See you soon, Mittweida, Chemnitz, and Weimar.
