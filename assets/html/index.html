    <h2>Core Features</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2">
        <h4>Coding in Seconds</h4>
        <p>Use Mimosa's command line to build out a skeleton app that is ready to go with transpilers, pre-processors, and a server if you need one. Or use a pre-built skeleton or example app already equipped with your favoriate libraries.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h4>Watch And Serve Assets</h4>
        <p>Mimosa will keep track of your assets and when you save something kick off all sorts of awesome. Mimosa will also optionally serve assets for you or invoke a node server so that you only need a single process running during development.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2">
        <h4>Convention + Config</h4>
        <p>Sane defaults keep you coding instead of figuring out config. If you stick close to Mimosa's conventions you may never look at or update the configuration. But Mimosa is heavily configurable if you find yourself needing to vary away from its conventions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h4>Concise Command Line</h4>
        <p>Mimosa has just a few commands to master and you won't need to invent your own. Mimosa's commands have flags to engage when you want perform common tasks like minify, concatenate, or package your application.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Modules</h2>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2">
        <h4>Utility & Library Integrations</h4>
        <p>Live reload, Bower, jshint, eslint, ember.js, and the <a href="./modules.html">list goes on</a>. Building a module is simple, so if the one you deeply need doesn't exist, bridging the gap is a piece of cake.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h4>Compilers</h4>
        <p>SASS, Less, Stylus, CoffeeScript, 6to5, Handlebars, Jade and dozens of others. Mimosa's core provides the heavy lifting for compilers making writing a compiler module easy, so there plenty from which to chose.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2">
        <h4>Testing</h4>
        <p>Karma, Testem, QUnit, and Mocha are a few of the testing modules out there, some with deep intergrations with libraries like Ember.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h4>Module Loading</h4>
        <p>Mimosa's AMD/require.js support is second to none, but if commonjs & browserify are your thing, there are modules for that too.</p>
